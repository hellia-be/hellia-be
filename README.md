### About Me
As a Strategic Cybersecurity Consultant and DevSecOps Leader, I partner with C-suite executives and security leaders to transform how organizations integrate security into their digital transformation journey. With 10+ years of experience driving enterprise security initiatives across 15+ countries, I specialize in building comprehensive DevSecOps programs that reduce vulnerabilities by up to 45% while accelerating time-to-market.

My strategic expertise encompasses DevSecOps transformation, application security architecture, security program leadership, and executive advisory services. I excel at translating complex security challenges into actionable business strategies, enabling organizations to achieve both security excellence and operational efficiency.

Currently, I'm leading the development of an innovative managed DevSecOps platform that empowers enterprises to embed security-by-design principles throughout their SDLC, achieving measurable risk reduction while maintaining development velocity. My approach combines deep technical expertise with executive-level strategic thinking to deliver solutions that align with business objectives.
